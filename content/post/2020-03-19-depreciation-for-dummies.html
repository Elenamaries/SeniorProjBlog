<p>Did you know that the United States tax-code-makers are actually not the worst? Did you know that they aren’t trying to squeeze you out for everything you are worth? Did you know that they actually want you to build families, be independent, and get an advanced education? Honestly, I didn’t! But through a project that I am currently working on, I have come to find out that they have created and allowed innumerable ways for Americans to save money, and even incentivize certain things like getting married, having children, going to school, preparing for retirement, and starting a business?</p>
<p>One way that the government incentivizes businesses to grow and make money, and for the economy to prosper, is through depreciation. Unlike what most people think, depreciation isn’t about how much an item is (or isn’t) worth. It actually acts as a tax deduction, or tax break. How? Well when a company purchases something new (like a building, car, tools, etc…) that will help them be more efficient, they can go through a process to calculate its depreciation. The government assumes that a percentage of your income is because you bought this new item that increased your production (and revenue), and essentially allow you to say you made less than you really did (therefore making it so you owe less taxes). This is actually an amazing tool that the government has created that allows business owners to reduce the amount they owe in taxes, which might allow them to spend that money elsewhere (which also helps the economy at the same time). There is an extensive list of things that can (and should) be depreciated - things like buildings, cars, tools, equipment, computers, phones, appliances, furniture, patents, softwares, etc… Dependent upon the item, it can also be depreciated and claimed on your taxes for a number of years (typically 5 - 39 years).</p>
<p>Depreciation is a phenomenal tool for businesses looking to save money to spend elsewhere. The tax code allows and encourages things like this that ultimately aid the individual American. The government is nothing without its citizens, and if the citizens aren’t thriving, they aren’t either. They want to provide as many opportunities for the American Dream as possible, and one major way is though creating tax code that encourages families, business owners, and those who want to create a better, more independent like for themselves. This can be done through utilizing things in the tax code, specifically designed to save us money.</p>
