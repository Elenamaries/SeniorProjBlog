If you are looking to manipulate PDF files with R, you are in luck. There is a package called Staplr that allows you to combine PDFs, remove pages, and even fill in a PDF.  
(See documentation at: https://pridiltal.github.io/staplr/ )

* Make sure that you have something called “pdftk” installed, or else this package will not work correctly.


You can “staple” or combine 2+ PDFs into one file is to use the staplr::staple_pdf()    command. 

An easy way to do this is by creating a folder where the PDFs are that you want to combine, and set it to a variable (pdf_files in my case). Then specify what you want the new file to be named (TaxPacket.pdf in my case).

As shown above, you can also remove pages with the  staplr::remove_pages() command. Just specify which pages you would like gone. 

Another feature of Staplr, is filling in a PDF. Just use   staplr::get_fields()  , and staplr::set_fields() .

The result is a filled in field! Continue setting any fields you want filled in, and then set it once using the staplr::set_fields() command. 
Don’t be afraid to give it a go! It is amazing what this package can do.
