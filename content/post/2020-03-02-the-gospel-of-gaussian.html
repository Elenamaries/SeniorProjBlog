<p>As someone who has taken a number of college-level statistics classes (and quite enjoyed them), I took them as I was given, and I accepted the general principles as gospel. I have since found out, that how statistics, probability, and risk are taught, and what I believed to be “truth” and a surety, is actually just another hypothesis (ironic, right?). We are taught that nothing is 100%, but I never thought (or was taught) to question and be skeptical of how “modern-day” statistics and probability is used.</p>
<p>Reading “The Black Swan” by Nassim Nicholas Taleb opened my eyes about how the Gaussian Bell Curve is the gospel truth, as far as statistics goes, but is that right? Does the average really matter? What does that tell us that we already Dont know? Shouldn’t we be investigating why the outliers happened, or <em>how</em> they happened? Wouldn’t that tell us more about what is possible, and show us the scope?</p>
<p>The Gaussian Bell Curve leads us to believe that, virtually anything outside of the initial standard deviation is unlikely to happen, and therefore, can be ignored. “The likelihood of so-and-so happening is so minuscule. We can ignore that risk.” Or, “this is an outlier, it doesn’t follow the trend and hypothesis, so it will be ignored.” But isn’t anything that has ever changed history been unpredicted? If it was predictable, would it have really changed our world as we know it today? What we don’t know is more important and concerning than what we do know, because “what we know shouldn’t hurt us”.</p>
<p>We forget how common unpredictability is in our everyday life. We tend to ignore the randomness, but the reality is, that things rarely (maybe never) go according to plan. So instead of predicting, let’s prepare (like Blah suggests). Let’s look at the consequences of what would happen if the impossible happened. Let’s figure out why something that had a .01% chance of happening, happened. Because not only is that possible, but it is much more probable than we may believe.</p>
<p>After all, we can never actually prove something to be correct; we can only disprove it (regardless of how much evidence you have to back it up). This concept should motivate us to never look to confirm our theory (this means nothing and can never happen), but to see if it can be disproved. This idea makes outliers much more interesting, and shifts the focus there, instead of what is contained in the 62.5%. The impact of the outlier typically holds a much greater weight in reality than is ever given to them in the gospel of Gaussian. So why is Gaussian gospel?</p>
